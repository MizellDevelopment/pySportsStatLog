# pySportsStatLog

The initial objective of the project is to be able to watch a soccer game and create statistics with time stamps and basic field location (third of field). The app will have a GUI so it can be used more easily while showing all information inputted.

## Acknowledgments

* Hat tip to anyone whose code was used
* The project was started from watching soccer games from a league without easily available statistics and where a lot of errors were done. It is to track what teams should work on and I have plans to use it while coaching.
